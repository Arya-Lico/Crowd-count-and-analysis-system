# Crowd-count-and-analysis-system
This project is all about analysis of the crowd count and responding with rush hours(if any) for a particular day . The project was completely developed in Python3.


=========================DEPENDENCIES=========================
-tkinter
-numpy
-matlplotlib.pyplot




=========================GUIDE TO USE==========================

The projectehas two parts that work independently:-
      1)Entry-Exit(Polling-GUI)
      2)RUN ME(Crowd-Aount-Analysis)

The Polling GUI is designed such that it will record entry and exit of every individual entering a particular area. The output of this GUI is used by Crowd-Count-Analysis system to process the data and represent the  processed output in form of scatter graph. 









PS:- The output is still raw. The project needs a lot of improve which I will keep updating here. Also, I am making a predicting system that will predict the rush hours depending on the analysis of Crowd-Count-Analysis system
